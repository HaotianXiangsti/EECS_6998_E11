# Week 5 Reports

I throughly read the [paper of ForestNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.05479.pdf) and downloaded the dataset.

I use the checkpoint hc in [SAM (Segment Anything Model)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), the smallest number of model parameters among all three ckpts (ha, hb, hc), to try the segment result without finetuning. 
The segmentation is not good. SAM barely recognizes the boundary of the forest. I will hand on to finetune the SAM this week to whether it will improve the SAM on land images or not.

Not too much last week, as I am preparing the PhD interviews.
